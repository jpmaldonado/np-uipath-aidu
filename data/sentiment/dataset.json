out.","440":"I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.","441":"I'd love to go back.","442":"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast\/lunch.","443":"Nothing special.","444":"Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!","445":"Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!","446":"Will not be back.","447":"Sauce was tasteless.","448":"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.","449":"My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.","450":"I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.","451":"Food was so gooodd.","452":"I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.","453":"I was so insulted.","454":"The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.","455":"The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever

they didn't bring that either.","481":"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.","482":"Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.","483":"The selection of food was not the best.","484":"Delicious and I will absolutely be back!","485":"This isn't a small family

your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.","624":"Pretty awesome place.","625":"Ambience is perfect.","626":"Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.","627":"Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.","628":"I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.","629":"The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!","630":"Four stars for the food & the guy in the

nachos are a MUST HAVE!","786":"We will not be coming back.","787":"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.","788":"The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.","789":"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.","790":"When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.","791":"Once your food arrives it's meh.","792":"Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.","793":"The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.","794":"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.","795":"So good I am
