Card was previously added to the XXXX payments center to keep on file for digital purchases. Subscription service was linked to card thru XXXX. Renewal time came around and card had expires as I forgot about the subscription from a year ago. XXXX as punishment issued a ban for any adding of cards to my entire XXXX account. Contacted XXXX.

Having a card reissued for the same card number ( new exp and cvv ) is not an indicator of fraud or money laundering etc. That is a common  practice of a bank to issue a new card with a new exp. I feel XXXX has been unfair and very deceptive about accepting payment and giving support which did not solve any issues.,Transaction Issues

I am frustrated at the general consensus that mortgage companies are allowed to collect their interest upfront and not refund the money back if the loan is paid off early.

Not collect the interest on a note based on 30 years even if it is paid off in 5. I just think that as consumers the mortgage companies should be giving us a choice.,Loan issues

I have an FHA loan with Pacific Union Financial.

I did that in XXXX and was given a refund of the overpayment in taxes on XXXX/17. Recently my taxes were again paid and I have an overage of greater than {$5000.00}.
